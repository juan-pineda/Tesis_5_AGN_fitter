# Tesis_5_AGN_fitter
---------------------

In this repository it is available the information associated with my undergraduate thesis: objectives, schedule, data, codes and documents. This thesis is a part of the project [AGNfitter](https://github.com/GabrielaCR/AGNfitter) which consist of a Python algorithm implementing a fully Bayesian MCMC method to fit the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxies from the sub-mm to the UV. The main purpose is robustly disentangle the physical processes responsible for the emission of the sources.

The bibliography used to understand the active galactic nuclei (AGN) as a first approximation is:
