# Tesis_5_AGN_fitter
---------------------

In this repository it is available the information associated with my undergraduate thesis: objectives, schedule, data, codes and documents. This thesis is a part of the project [AGNfitter](https://github.com/GabrielaCR/AGNfitter) which consist of a Python algorithm implementing a fully Bayesian MCMC method to fit the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxies from the sub-mm to the UV. The main purpose is robustly disentangle the physical processes responsible for the emission of the sources.

# Problem Statement

In this thesis we propose to investigate how the physical parameters inferred from data that comes from nearby AGN change using differents models used for accretion disk, cold dust and torus. The purpose of this is to study the fraction of AGN in the Universe which is obscured by dust and gas.


# Objectives

## General objetive:
 * Determine the relation between physical parameters inferred from data and differents models used for accretion disk, cold dust and torus in nearby AGNs by applying the most recent version of AGNfitter to a data sets of nearby AGN.

## Specific objetives:
 * Define the suitable set of physical models for the torus, accretion disk and cold dust for nearby AGNs to be implemented in AGNfitter to fit the spectral energy distribution.
 
  * Evaluate the photometric data sets of the nearby AGN to chose the filter curves required to calculate the actual fluxes of each spectral band in each AGN.
 
  * Generate a catalogue of parameters for each physical model in each of the three emission processes studied from the results obtained when applying AGNfitter to the data set.
