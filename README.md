# Tesis_5_AGN_fitter
---------------------

In this repository it is available the information associated with my undergraduate thesis: objectives, schedule, data, codes and documents. This thesis is a part of the project [AGNfitter](https://github.com/GabrielaCR/AGNfitter) which consist of a Python algorithm implementing a fully Bayesian MCMC method to fit the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxies from the sub-mm to the UV. The main purpose is robustly disentangle the physical processes responsible for the emission of the sources.

# Problem Statement

In this thesis we propose to investigate the relation between physical parameters inferred from data that comes from nearby AGN and differents models used for accretion disk, cold dust and torus.
